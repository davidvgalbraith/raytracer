This image shows a gourd rendered from hundreds of triangles in an OBJ file. Since the triangles have unspecified vertex normals, it only has flat shading. I decided to make it at least a little interesting by shading the triangles randomly yellow, magenta, cyan or white. This image was generated by java raytracer.Main examples/input-60.txt examples/input-61.obj examples/image-6.jpg in about three minutes.
